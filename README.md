You can think of an array as a list of items. 

Each item is a data type. 

Each item in the array can also be referred to as an index. 

Arrays in Javascript are 0 indexed meaning that the first list item is in position 0 NOT 1. 

Moreover, a for loop is a piece of logic that looks through the indexes. 

You can get it do many things with an if and else statement. 

The code above is an example of that. It could be the for loops seem a little advanced right now. But trust me, once you get them down, you have added a big tool to your set.
