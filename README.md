# Single-Page-App
Using AJAX for a single page web app. I'm looking to adapt this code to WriterFlow 

WriterFlow in large part works as a single page MVC web application. 

Accordingly, I want to be able to construct a Model which is a 'random' prompt, and render that model on the same Index view. 

This means changing the url so I can access the right action, without actually reloading the page. 

This is where AJAX comes in handy, and this is where this Single-Page-App will teach me how to do just that.
